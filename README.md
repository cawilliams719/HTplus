This is a personal project in which I will recreate my honors thesis through programming only (In Progress). Please also see cawilliams719/LCD_stations repository which demonstrates two scripts I utilized to automating tasks for my thesis when I was finalizing the analysis.

## Data
The [National Land Cover Database](ftp://islay.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/cms/v1/landcover/vote/) was utilized in additional to the [Local Climatological Data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/quality-controlled-local-climatological-data-qclcd)
